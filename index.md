# Welcome
I am a researcher and PhD student in computer science at [Carl von Ossietzky Universit√§t Oldenburg, Germany](https://uol.de/en/computingscience/groups/formal-methods/team/cedric-richter) from fall 2019 to spring 2025 (expected). I am part of the [Formal Methods](https://uol.de/en/computingscience/groups/formal-methods) and I am supervised by [Heike Wehrhehim](https://uol.de/en/computingscience/groups/formal-methods/team/heike-wehrheim). My research focuses on building intelligent systems for finding bugs and for ensuring the correctness of code.

I am currently on the academic job market, applying to PostDoc positions in fields related to AI4SE, Software Engineering and Formal Verification. Please take a look at my [CV](https://cedricrupb.github.io/RichterCV.pdf).


## Research
Software Developers make mistakes. They are often simple, easy to fix and largely overlooked. My research goal is to find out **why** these simple mistakes happen and **how** we can help software developers avoid them. I believe that **intelligent systems** that can learn from developer mistakes play a key role in achieving this goal.

My research work focuses on three aspects towards achieving this goal: **1.** Investigating models that learn to detect bugs from previous developer
mistakes (e.g. [ICST'22](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9787824), [ASE'22](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3551349.3561156), [ASE'23](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10298391)), including [RealiT](https://github.com/cedricrupb/nbfbaselines), an effective neural bug detector for detecting and fixing simple mistakes,. **2.** Finding new ways to adapt and combine verification
tools that can automatically prove the absence or presence of bugs (e.g. [TACAS'19](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-17502-3_19), [ASE'20](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3324884.3416633), [journalASE'20](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10515-020-00270-x), [FASE'22](https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.12657/54029/1/978-3-030-99429-7.pdf#page=61), [TACAS'24](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-57256-2_20)), including [PeSCo](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-17502-3_19) and [BubaaK-SpLit](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-57256-2_20), two software verifiers that achieved the third
place in the ReachSafety category of [SV-COMP'19](https://sv-comp.sosy-lab.org/2019/results/results-verified/) and the second place in the SoftwareSystems category of [SV-COMP'24](https://sv-comp.sosy-lab.org/2024/results/results-verified/). **3.** Cooperation between intelligent learning-based systems and formal verification techniques (e.g. [FASE'24](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-57259-3_13)).
